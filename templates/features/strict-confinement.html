        <p>Get isolation and minimise risk with strict confinement. Run sophisticated and otherwise high-risk internet of things (IoT) workloads while vulnerabilities are limited to a single application. </p>
        <p>With strict confinement enabled, the system ensures that MicroK8s and its container workloads can only access files, system resources, and hardware for which access has been granted.</p>
        <p>By restricting Kubernetes to the absolutely necessary permissions, strict confinement eliminates vulnerable interactions both within the host device and externally, greatly reducing the attack surface.</p>
