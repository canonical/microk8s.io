        <p>MicroK8s supports automated cluster creation and life cycle management with ClusterAPI (CAPI).</p>
        <p>CAPI abstracts away the details of infrastructure provisioning, networking, and other low-level tasks, so users can define their desired cluster configuration using simple YAML manifests. </p>
        <p>MicroK8s and CAPI allow you to easily provision clusters and deploy them behind proxies.</p>
        <p>Rolling upgrades for high-availability (HA) clusters and worker notes mean you can upgrade clusters with no downtime. It also supports in-place upgrades for non-HA control planes.</p>
