        <p>MicroK8s was always simple to install, but now it's simple to install, the way you want it. Use a custom Container Network Interface (CNI), set specific service options, configure registries, and enable the add-ons you want - all without an extra keystroke. Brilliant for automated, repeatable, reliable deployment and especially useful for air-gapped instals, embedded applications, and integration with public clouds.</p>
